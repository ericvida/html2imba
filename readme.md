# HTML 2 IMBA
An app built with [imba](https://imba.io) to convert HTML snippets to Imba's indented templating Syntax. 

The app is live at [html2imba.web.app](https://html2imba.web.app)

P.S. I built this in a couple of days without any previous experience with building compilers, so PR's are very welcome.
